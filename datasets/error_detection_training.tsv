We have an intuitive understanding of how the world works. Our intuition works well in our everyday lives, but it doesn’t quite match reality.    0
This idea is known as macrorealism, in that a macroscopic object such as your house is still there even when you’re not looking at it.    0
If you open the box and see heads, then ten seconds later when you open the box you must also see heads.    0
If macrorealism is true, then middle observations being always the same as the first and last observation, always opposite or always random are the only possibilities for the experiment.    0
This reality condition can be expressed in a simple inequality known as the Leggett-Garg Inequality.    0

It’s one more example of how our intuition fails when it comes to quantum theory.   0
